# TechChassis_Project
Developed TechChassis, an autonomous robot designed to move on its own, avoid obstacles, and handle loads smoothly. Using ROS2 Humble, Gazebo, and RViz2, created and tested the full navigation system, including mapping, localization, path planning, and motion control. Used sensor fusion with LiDAR, IMU, and wheel encoder data to make the robot’s movement more accurate and stable. All functions were tested through simulations to ensure reliable navigation in changing environments. Also designed the robot’s chassis in Fusion 360 and prepared the embedded control setup using STM32CubeIDE and Arduino IDE for future hardware implementation.
